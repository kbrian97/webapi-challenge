Mention two parts of Express that you learned about this week.

 Describe Middleware?

 Middleware is custom code or used from a third party library that allows us to inject code before it reaches the server endpoints, used for logging and authentication.

 Describe a Resource?

 A resource is anything the client needs to manage as part of the Application.

 What can the API return to help clients know if a request was successful?
200 or 201


 How can we partition our application into sub-applications?

Can use routes that can store seperate files then call them into the main index.js
